DAY 4
#converting info to track
##spice notes
track are for every metal layer
ports need to be on insrection of horizontal and vertical tracks
press g for grid and see if they intersect
width of standard cell, whole multiple of the x width
port does mean anything to magic
extract lef file then ports are what the pins are
power ground atttach to metal 1
a any y have to atach to local
have define purpuse of each port
using port class output
port use signal

#Commands
First
in tkcon main window grid 0.46um 0.34um 023um 0.17um then save sky130_vsdinv.mag
magic -T sky130_vsdinv.mag &
write lef '''creates a left file for given file

then find place of lef file and cp <file_name> <location of something/picorv32a/src/
then have to change config.tcl

then edit config file to look right like the following/
want to use both lef files
so package require openlane 0.9
can add -tag(keep going with) -overwrite to prep -design picorv32a along with 2 .lef files

have to correct slack voilatons 

#delay tables
assumtions each node driving same load and that c1=c2=c3=c3=25F
indical buffer at same level. 

the load at the output varies it is not constant(capacitance)
verying input transations different delays
#delay table
output load and input slew was collected for each buffer
one buffer of fixed size and threshold voltage delay was caluclated for each and every cell.
each kind of gate
buffer size 1 mean p mos and nmos of size 2 defined size that is different.
change size change resistance
use it like a look up table
build equation to find values for given problem
delay find of first cell than find it of second cell
##usage
want to calculate the skrew
output of buffer goes into next buffer but need second transition table for one going into another
in example skrew is 0. branching logi. but if buffer and trunk of tree because it is varying the delay values 
would be different meaning different delay frequency. meaning non 0 skrew value
the small differene at one level will grow to a very big problem
#lab steps
wns is all the slack
what to strike balance between chip area and delay
can make changes like set $::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY)
line between area and time
can view chip area in synth then slack decreases
run_placement look at OVFL want to be close to 0
do same magic command as early to look at chip placement from different day
#timing analysis
